        <h1>Role of Programming in Software Development</h1>
        <div class="outer">
            <div class="inner">
                A computer "speaks" in a "language" using strings of the numerals "1" and
                "0"â€”known as binary code. A programming language allows us to translate 
                the computer's binary code into something humans can understand and write.
            </div>
            <div>
                These languages enable us to communicate with computers, build and 
                organize code, specify functionality and behavior, automate and improve 
                efficiency, collaborate and share code, and solve problems creatively.
            </div>

                <b>Example:</b> Java.
            </div>
            <div class="inn">
                Java is known for its object-oriented programming paradigm, making it 
                suitable for building large-scale enterprise applications. Developers 
                use Java to organize code into classes and modules, promoting code 
                reusability and maintainability. The language's structure helps in 
                creating well-organized and structured software projects.

                <p id="p1">JAVA</p><br>
                <p class="p1">Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web 
                    applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over 
                    two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is 
                    a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that 
                    can be used as a platform in itself.</p>

            <div class="s">
                <p id="p2">PYTHON</p><br>
                <p class="p2">Python is commonly used for developing websites and 
                    software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. 
                    Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many 
                    non-programmers, such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of 
                    everyday tasks, like organising finances.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="t">
                <p id="p3">C</p><br>
                <p class="p3">The C language is a high-level, general-purpose programming 
                    language. It provides a straightforward, consistent, powerful 
                    interface for programming systems. That's why the C language is 
                    widely used for developing system software, application software, 
                    and embedded systems.</p>
