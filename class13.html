            <p>A programming language is a set of instructions written by a programmer to 
            deliver instructions to the computer to perform and accomplish a task. This 
            set of instructions is usually viewed as incomprehensible code structured 
            following a definite programming language syntax.At its core, a programming 
            language is a set of instructions that enables humans to communicate with 
            computers—using a series of symbols that serve as a bridge that allows humans 
            to turn our ideas into instructions computers can understand. Some of the 
            best programming languages to help you get a job include Python, JavaScript, 
            Java, and HTML.</p>

        <div id="java">
            <h1 class="java">Java</h1>
            <p>Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.Java is an extremely transferable programming language used across platforms and different types of devices, from smartphones to smart TVs.</p>

            <p>Java is an extremely transferable programming language used across platforms and different types of devices, from smartphones to smart TVs. It's used for creating mobile and web apps, enterprise software, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, gaming, big data, distributed, and cloud-based applications among other types.The full form of Java is "Just Another Virtual Accelerator". Java is not an abbreviation but some programmers made a full form. Basically, Java doesn't have any full form or special meaning. This full form is used jokingly by the programmers.Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.</p>

        <h1 class="py">Python</h1>
        <p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.Python is a programming language that is widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning (ML). Developers use Python because it is efficient and easy to learn and can run on many different platforms.</p>
        <img src="python.png" height="250px" width="250px">
        <p>Python is a multipurpose, high-level, object-oriented programming language — three properties that make it popular with coders and developers. Python is multipurpose because it can be used to create software and apps, design websites, and automate repetitive tasks.Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>

            <h1 class="html">HTML</h1>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page.</p>
            <img src="html.png" height="250px" width="250px">
            <p>The basic HTML structure is fixed with doctype declaration, html, head, title, and body tags. The content then can be added to the body tag. HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.</p>

        <div id="css">
            <h1 class="css">CSS</h1>
            <p>CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style sheets” which are equally called CSS files.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
            <img src="CSS.png" height="250px" width="250px">
            <p>The three types of CSS are external, internal, and inline. External CSS is a file that HTML files will link to. Internal CSS is specified at the beginning of an HTML document. Inline CSS is written for a specific element in the HTML document.Sources. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, offers a flexible way to style web content, with styles originating from browser defaults, user preferences, or web designers.Inheritance, the Cascade, and Specificity are the big three. Understanding these concepts will allow you to write very powerful stylesheets and also save time by writing fewer CSS rules.On the other hand CSS is independent of HTML and will be usable with many of the markup languages which are XML-based. HTML is implemented to define the web page structure as well as structure.</p>

        <div id="js">
            <h1 class="js">JavaScript</h1>
            <p>This is the world's most popular programming language. Coders mainly use it on 
            the world wide web to create web interfaces or websites. It can be an 
            easy-to-learn language. Programmers may classify JavaScript as a high-level 
            language, multi-paradigm, and just in time compiled. It features dynamic 
            typing, first-class functions, and prototype-based object orientation.</p>
            <img src="Js.webp" height="250px" width="250px">
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page.JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games. It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.</p>
